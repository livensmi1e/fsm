## FSM

Project to learn FSM Go implementation, from:

-   [Finite State Machines in Go](https://sebinbabu.com/posts/finite-state-machines-in-go/)
-   [GFSM - A Simple and Fast FSM for Go](https://sysdev.me/gfsm-a-simple-and-fast-fsm-for-go/)

This project also explores:

-   One way to handle error ([Errors are values](https://go.dev/blog/errors-are-values), [Golang Error Handling lesson by Rob Pike](https://jxck.hatenablog.com/entry/golang-error-handling-lesson-by-rob-pike)).
-   Builder pattern for FSM construction.
-   Support **states, transition rules, and callback functions**.
-   Two way to construct fsm using declarative struct based and builder pattern.
-   Visualize in Mermaid
